= Discipline =

* Be a good role model
* Be consistent
* Be calm and brief
* Be quick
* Pick your battles
* Be realistic
    * It's unreasonable to expect a child to wait hours for you on a phone call 
* Catch your child being good
    * Ensure to reward your child if you ever catch them doing something good
* Remind your child that you love them
    * After you are done with a discipline moment, say something nice and give them a hug. This shows that you're not willing to dwell on the bad behaviour.


== Goals of Discipline ==   
* When she does something wrong, ask her how it could have been handeled better
* Lack of boundaries don't make them happy; they feel insecure or lost
* Speak to your child how you would want them to speak to you. Ensure to tell them that you still love and respect them afterwards. Listen to their reasoning and explain what the correct behaviour is.
