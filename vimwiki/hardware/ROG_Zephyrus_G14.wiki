= Sound Issues =

There are a variety of sources of this problem. 

== Dumb Issues ==

* Keyboard Mute Button 
  * `Fn+F1` to toggle
* Headphones mute button
  * Check to see if your headphones are muted
* Check hardware volume switches (M1 + M2)


= Screen =

== Screen Brightness ==

{{{bash
sudo echo $1 > brightness
}}}

== Screen Resolution ==

Usually issues happen because screen resolution is too high.

Personally, I went to about:config in Waterfox and set:
{{{
layout.css.devPixelsPerPx = 1.5
}}}
