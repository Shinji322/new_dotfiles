* Using Plug Install might give a "git fatal error for terminal prompts" or "fatal: could not read username for https://github.com". This happens because it uses your github account for some reason
	* To fix this, you need to generate an ssh-key
		* run `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`
		* Essentially, you just need to start the ssh-agent => `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
		* ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

* After doing that I got another error with something regarding permissions to access the repository
  * Unsure why but cloning another repository fixed this
