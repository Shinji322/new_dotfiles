= Filename =

This has a parent folder of "copyright"
As for the image itself, if it contains "yuri", it will be prefixed with "yuri--" for regex purposes
Prefixing and postfixing each character is an "=" sign. 
If you have nerd font enabled, this may look weird
All characters will be seperated with "="
Then, there will be double underscore before an md5
{{{
%copyright:underscores%/<"yuri"-->=%character:separator==%=__%md5%.%ext%
}}}
