= Purpose =

Rsync is useful for syncing files across two different folders. Those folders may be anywhere, from local directory to ssh connections.
It is more effective than copy pasting because it skips files that have been unchanged.

= Examples =

{{{bash
rsync Original/* Backup/
}}}
>This syncs files from "Original" to "Backup"


{{{bash
rsync -r Original/ Backup/
}}}
>Recursively sync (include all files and subdirectories)


{{{bash
rsync Original Backup/
}}}
>Creates an "Original" folder in Backup


{{{bash
rsync -a
}}}
>Archival copy
Used for archival purposes but does not preserve hard links.


{{{bash
rsync --dry-run -v
}}}
>Instead of making changes, it simply tells us what files we are going to copy before we do it


{{{bash
rsync --delete 
}}}
>Ensures two folders are mirrored
This is a dangerous option but it ensures the two directories are perfectly synced


{{{bash
rsync -P
}}}
>Progress bar
