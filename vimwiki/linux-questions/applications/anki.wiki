= Creating Anki Cards from Markdown =

By default, simply run 

{{{bash
npm install -g mdanki
}}}
>Make sure `~/.local/share/npm/bin` is in your path

Then, they can be created like so:
{{{bash
mdanki library.md anki.apkg --config settings.json
}}}

== Config ==
Using settings.json, we can configure how we make the anki card.

{{{json
{
"template": {
    "formats": {
        "question": "{{Front}}",
        "answer"  : "{{FrontSide}}\n\n<hr id=\"answer\">\n\n{{Back}}",
         "css"     : ".card {\n font-family: arial;\n font-size: 20px;\n text-align: center;\n color: black;\n background-color: white;\n}"
               }
            }
}
}}}


== Formatting ==

By default, anki cards must be formated like so:

## What's the Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax.
Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats,
but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.

## Who created Markdown?

John Gruber created the Markdown language in 2004 in collaboration with
Aaron Swartz on the syntax.

## Binary tree

In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.
