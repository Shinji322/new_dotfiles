If you get some permissions error like: "`Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.39/containers/json: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied`", you may need to run this command

{{{bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
}}}
>This will allow you to run docker commands
You will have to restart if you run these commands.


== Systemd Service ==

After installing docker, you will need to do the following:
* Enable systemd service
* Start the systemd service

You can do so by running the following commands: 
{{{bash
systemctl enable docker.service
systemctl start docker.service
}}}
