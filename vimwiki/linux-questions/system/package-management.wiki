= Packages =

A *package* is an archive containing:
* all of the (compiled) files of an application
* metadata about the application, such as application name, version, dependencies, etc.
* installation files and directives for pacman
* (optionally) extra files to make your life easier, such as a start/stop script



= Pacman =

Arch's package manager pacman can install, update, and remove those packages. Using packages instead of compiling and installing programs yourself has various benefits:

* *easily updatable*: pacman will update existing packages as soon as updates are available
* *dependency checks*: pacman handles dependencies for you, you only need to specify the program and pacman installs it together with every other program it needs
* *clean removal*: pacman has a list of every file in a package; this way, no files are unintentionally left behind when you decide to remove a package.


== WARNINGS ==
* Run pacman -Syu instead of pacman -Sy. Check Arch wiki for more. 
[[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman***REMOVED***Usage]] 
`pacman -Syu`


== Pacman Practice ==

=== Install all Optional Dependencies ===
{{{bash
sudo pacman -S --asdeps --needed $(pacman -Si package_name | sed -n '/^Opt/,/^Conf/p' | sed '$d' | sed 's/^Opt.*://g' | sed 's/^\s*//g' | tr '\n' ' ')
}}}

=== Purge (remove unnedded dependencies) ===
{{{bash
sudo pacman -Rs package_name
}}}
