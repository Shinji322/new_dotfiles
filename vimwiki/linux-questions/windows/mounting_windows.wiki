= TL;DR Command =

{{{bash
HARD_DRIVE_PARTITION="/dev/sdb1" ***REMOVED*** example
sudo pacman -S ntfs-3g nfs-utils
mount -t ntfs $HARD_DRIVE_PARTITION /mnt
}}}


= Errors =

== Windows is hibernated, refused to mount ==
{{{
Error mounting /dev/sda2/
The NTFS partition is in unsafe state
Windows is hibernated, refused to mount
}}}
This happens because Windows hibernates instead of shutting down for faster boot times


This may wipe data that is not saved so do this scarcely:
{{{bash
sudo ntfs-3g -o remove_hiberfile $HARD_DRIVE_PARTITION /mnt
}}}


In windows, you should shut down like so:
{{{powershell
shutdown /s 
}}}
>`/t 0` may be added for immediate shutdown

A simpler approach to actually shutting down Windows is to 'restart' (rather than 'shutdown'), but then intercept the boot process and boot Linux instead of letting it boot Windows.
