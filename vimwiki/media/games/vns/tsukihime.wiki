* Kohaku gives Shiki knife; Hisui steps back
    * The Arimas held the gift and sent it to the mansion
    * It was apparently a gift from the father 
    * Kohaku demonstrates that this is a knife after Shiki didn't know what it was. 
    * It has the characters "7" and "night" on it.
* Ciel witnesses banter between Arihiko and Shiki. She comments, "Oh I'm so envious. I really admire how your friendship allows such understanding without you getting worried over each other".
