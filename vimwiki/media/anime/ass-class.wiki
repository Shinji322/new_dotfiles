Assassination Classroom Season 1:

Rewatched
Very boring worldbuilding and dialogue. Nagisa, while being a fairly interesting character, is just a plot device. While his personal character is expanded on later, it makes the first few episodes fairly boring. However, if you can look over all of these flaws, Assassination Classroom is rediculously fun. It's fun to watch Korosensei's interactions with these students. However, fun times don't last forever. Because of how dumb and cringey btu fin it is, the ending of the Second Season hits very hard.
