# Encoding

Encoding is the technique of putting information into long-term memory, essentially. After learning a piece of information, the optimal time to encode that is only a couple seconds. 
In order to effectively do this, whenever consuming some information, you must be sure to **always relate it to the big picture** and create an organizational system so that each picture knows where to fit.


Doing all of this in such a small time is, of course, unrealistic. As such, it is better to simply jump to the later stages in Bloom's Taxonomy:

## Bloom's Taxonmy

If you just jump to the later stages, specifically the evaluation step (big picture), then you will be much more productive.


## Things To Avoid!

* Taking notes right away
  * Organize the concepts in your head first (in relation to other concepts as well as the big picture)
  * Your notes should be written in a [mindmap](./assets/mindmap.rmd) instead
* Writing linear, wordy notes
  * This makes it so that you don't encode that memory into your head
  * Practice holding on to that information, taking in a little bit more information, and ask yourself **"How does this relate to the big picture?"**
    * If there are an overwhelming amount of connections, instead try the application step

# TL;DR

* Before reading, prime yourself by asking what are the **main concepts** 
  * Try to figure out what is relevant
* Try learning one thing, then a little bit about another topic, then think about how they relate to each other
* Create a Mind Map linking these two
  * Mindmaps should intentionally leave out words and information

* Step 1: Priming = 
  * look through the contents and make basic framework (it is gonna be uncomfortable) 
  * It is not about memorizing, it is about being comfortable with the discomfort and confusion
* Step 2: Organize = 
  * how does it fit here, and why should you know this and
  * what is the priority (simplify it to key takeaway) = how to apply, how to simplify
* Step 3: Relating = 
  * to the concepts you know, or something unrelated which seems like it
