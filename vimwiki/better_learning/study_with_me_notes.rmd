Step 1: Priming = look through the contents and make basic framework (it is gonna be uncomfortable) - It is not about memorizing, it is about being comfortable with the discomfort and confusion
Step 2: Organize = how does it fit here, and why should you know this and what is the priority (simplify it to key takeaway) = how to apply, how to simplify
Step 3: Relating = to the concepts you know, or something unrelated which seems like it
