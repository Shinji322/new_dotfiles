# My Notes

* Priming yourself
  * Skim the paragraph first, look for keywords
* Figure out relevant sentences
  * Not all sentences are important. Be sure to skim through non important sentences
  * Slow down on important sentences
    * Think about how it relates to the **big picture**


# TL;DR

S1: Keywords
S2 : Sentence Relevancy
S3 : Think about important sentences
S4: Make it click
